I replied and told him that I know what I'm doing and that it loses its connection to my network and the only way to reconnect it is to unplug it and go through the setup process every other day. Why won't it remember the settings and why is it constantly dropping?  I never heard back from Amazon after I explained this to them. I would throw this Echo in the lake if my wife would let me. A waste of $180.",

It's just supposed to work.  They want me to split my WiFi blah blah blah, come on Amazon, do better.  If it worked fine one day there is no reason it shouldn't have worked after that, so now it just sits on my desk.  I wanted to like it, and I did, or one day.",
